# gogs/gogs - Detailed Review

## 1. Overview & GitHub Stats

- **URL:** [https://github.com/gogs/gogs](https://github.com/gogs/gogs)
- **Stars:** 46802

## 2. Project Description

Gogs (Go Git Service) is an open-source, self-hosted Git service written in Go. It provides a lightweight, fast, and user-friendly alternative to platforms like GitHub and GitLab, with a minimal resource footprint. Designed for simplicity and ease of use, Gogs offers essential Git repository management, issue tracking, and collaboration tools without the complexity or overhead of larger solutions.

## 3. What Software Does It Replace?

Gogs serves as a viable alternative to:

- GitHub (self-hosted/Enterprise)
- GitLab (self-hosted/Community Edition)
- Bitbucket Server
- Gitea (a fork of Gogs with additional features)

## 4. Core Functionality

Key features of Gogs include:

- Git repository hosting with HTTP/SSH support
- Issue tracking and milestones
- Pull requests and code review
- User and organization management
- Webhooks and integrations
- Built-in wiki and file editor
- Multi-language support (internationalization)
- Lightweight and fast, even on low-resource systems

## 5. Pros and Cons

**Pros:**
- Extremely lightweight and resource-efficient
- Simple setup and configuration
- Intuitive, clean user interface
- Active community and regular updates
- Supports multiple databases (SQLite, MySQL, PostgreSQL)
- Docker support for easy deployment

**Cons:**
- Lacks some advanced features found in GitLab (e.g., CI/CD integration)
- Smaller ecosystem of plugins/extensions compared to GitHub/GitLab
- Limited built-in automation compared to commercial alternatives

## 6. Detailed Installation Guide (Self-host)

This guide covers deploying Gogs on an Ubuntu 22.04 server using Docker for simplicity and reliability.

### Prerequisites:
- Ubuntu 22.04 server
- Docker and Docker Compose installed
- Domain name pointed to your server (optional but recommended for production)

### Step 1: Install Docker and Docker Compose
Update your system and install Docker:
```bash
sudo apt update && sudo apt upgrade -y
sudo apt install docker.io docker-compose -y
sudo systemctl enable docker && sudo systemctl start docker
```

### Step 2: Create a Docker Compose File
Create a directory for Gogs and navigate into it:
```bash
mkdir gogs && cd gogs
```

Create a `docker-compose.yml` file:
```yaml
version: '3'

services:
  gogs:
    image: gogs/gogs
    container_name: gogs
    restart: unless-stopped
    ports:
      - "3000:3000"
      - "10022:22"
    volumes:
      - ./data:/data
    environment:
      - USER_UID=1000
      - USER_GID=1000
```

### Step 3: Deploy Gogs
Start the container with:
```bash
sudo docker-compose up -d
```

### Step 4: Configure Gogs
Open your browser and go to `http://your-server-ip:3000` (replace with your domain if configured). Follow the setup wizard:

1. **Database Settings:** Use SQLite3 (default, stored in `/data`).
2. **General Settings:** Set application URL, e.g., `http://your-domain.com:3000`.
3. **Admin Account:** Create an admin user.
4. Complete the installation.

### Step 5 (Optional): Set Up Reverse Proxy (Nginx)
For production use, set up Nginx as a reverse proxy. Install Nginx:
```bash
sudo apt install nginx -y
```

Create a new configuration file:
```bash
sudo nano /etc/nginx/sites-available/gogs
```

Add the following, replacing `your-domain.com` with your actual domain:
```nginx
server {
    listen 80;
    server_name your-domain.com;

    location / {
        proxy_pass http://localhost:3000;
        proxy_set_header Host $host;
        proxy_set_header X-Real-IP $remote_addr;
    }
}
```

Enable the site and restart Nginx:
```bash
sudo ln -s /etc/nginx/sites-available/gogs /etc/nginx/sites-enabled/
sudo nginx -t && sudo systemctl restart nginx
```

### Step 6: Secure with SSL (Optional but Recommended)
Use Let's Encrypt to add HTTPS:
```bash
sudo apt install certbot python3-certbot-nginx -y
sudo certbot --nginx -d your-domain.com
```

Your Gogs instance is now live and accessible securely!
