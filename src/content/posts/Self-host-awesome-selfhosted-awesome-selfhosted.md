## 6. Detailed Installation Guide (Self-host)

Since awesome-selfhosted is a directory rather than a single application, here's how to set up a typical self-hosted application from the list using Docker (using Nextcloud as an example):

### Prerequisites
- Ubuntu 22.04 LTS server
- Docker and Docker Compose installed
- Domain name pointed to your server (optional but recommended)

### Step 1: Install Docker
```bash
# Update system
sudo apt update && sudo apt upgrade -y

# Install Docker
curl -fsSL https://get.docker.com -o get-docker.sh
sudo sh get-docker.sh

# Install Docker Compose
sudo apt install docker-compose-plugin -y

# Add user to docker group
sudo usermod -aG docker $USER
newgrp docker
```

### Step 2: Create Nextcloud Docker Compose File
```bash
mkdir nextcloud && cd nextcloud
nano docker-compose.yml
```

Paste the following configuration:
```yaml
version: '3'

services:
  nextcloud:
    image: nextcloud:latest
    restart: always
    ports:
      - 8080:80
    volumes:
      - nextcloud_data:/var/www/html
    environment:
      - MYSQL_HOST=db
      - MYSQL_DATABASE=nextcloud
      - MYSQL_USER=nextcloud
      - MYSQL_PASSWORD=your_secure_password

  db:
    image: mariadb:10.6
    restart: always
    environment:
      - MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD=root_secure_password
      - MYSQL_DATABASE=nextcloud
      - MYSQL_USER=nextcloud
      - MYSQL_PASSWORD=your_secure_password
    volumes:
      - db_data:/var/lib/mysql

volumes:
  nextcloud_data:
  db_data:
```

### Step 3: Deploy Nextcloud
```bash
# Start the containers
docker compose up -d

# Check status
docker compose ps
```

### Step 4: Access and Configure
Open your browser and navigate to `http://your-server-ip:8080`. Complete the setup wizard by creating an admin account and configuring your database connection.

### Additional Considerations
- **Reverse Proxy:** Set up Nginx or Traefik for SSL and domain routing
- **Backups:** Implement regular backups of your Docker volumes
- **Updates:** Regularly update your containers with `docker compose pull && docker compose up -d`

For other applications listed in awesome-selfhosted, check each project's documentation for specific installation requirements, as they may require different technologies like Node.js, Python, or specific database systems.
