NocoBase is a rapidly growing open-source project that enables businesses and developers to build powerful applications without extensive coding knowledge. With over 15K stars on GitHub, it has gained significant traction in the no-code/low-code space.

## 2. Project Description
NocoBase is an **extensibility-first, open-source no-code/low-code platform** designed for creating business applications and enterprise solutions. It allows users to:  
‚úî Build custom applications with minimal coding  
‚úî Automate workflows and business processes  
‚úî Manage data with a flexible database structure

Unlike many proprietary no-code tools, NocoBase is **open-source**, meaning you can modify and extend it freely without vendor lock-in.

## 3. What Software Does It Replace?
NocoBase competes with several commercial and open-source alternatives, including:  
- **Airtable** (for database and automation)  
- **Retool** (for internal tool building)  
- **Appsmith** (open-source alternative for business apps)  
- **OutSystems/Mendix** (enterprise low-code platforms)  

Unlike these tools, NocoBase is **fully self-hostable** and **extensible** without licensing fees.

## 6. Detailed Installation Guide (Self-Host on Ubuntu)
NocoBase can be deployed using **Docker** for easy setup.  

### **Prerequisites:**  
- Ubuntu 20.04/22.04 (or any Linux distro with Docker)  
- Docker & Docker Compose installed  
- 2GB+ RAM (4GB recommended for production)  

### **Step-by-Step Setup:**  

#### **1. Install Docker & Docker Compose**  
```bash
# Install Docker
sudo apt update && sudo apt install -y docker.io
sudo systemctl enable --now docker

# Install Docker Compose
sudo curl -L "https://github.com/docker/compose/releases/latest/download/docker-compose-$(uname -s)-$(uname -m)" -o /usr/local/bin/docker-compose
sudo chmod +x /usr/local/bin/docker-compose
```

#### **2. Clone NocoBase Repository**  
```bash
git clone https://github.com/nocobase/nocobase.git
cd nocobase
```

#### **3. Configure Environment**  
Create a `.env` file:  
```bash
cp .env.example .env
```
Edit `.env` to set:  
```
DB_DIALECT=postgres
DB_HOST=postgres
DB_PORT=5432
DB_DATABASE=nocobase
DB_USER=nocobase
DB_PASSWORD=your_secure_password
```

#### **4. Start NocoBase with Docker Compose**  
```bash
docker-compose up -d
```

#### **5. Access the Application**  
Once running, open `http://your-server-ip:13000` in a browser.  

#### **6. (Optional) Set Up Nginx Reverse Proxy**  
For production, use Nginx to enable HTTPS:  
```nginx
server {
    listen 80;
    server_name yourdomain.com;

    location / {
        proxy_pass http://localhost:13000;
        proxy_set_header Host $host;
    }
}
```
Then, secure with Let‚Äôs Encrypt:  
```bash
sudo apt install certbot python3-certbot-nginx
sudo certbot --nginx -d yourdomain.com
```

### **Conclusion**  
NocoBase is a powerful open-source alternative to commercial no-code platforms, offering flexibility and control for businesses. While it requires some technical setup, its extensibility makes it ideal for custom solutions.
