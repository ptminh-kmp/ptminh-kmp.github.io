# louislam/dockge - Detailed Review

## 1. Overview & GitHub Stats
- **URL:** [https://github.com/louislam/dockge](https://github.com/louislam/dockge)
- **Stars:** 19225

## 2. Project Description
Dockge is an elegant, reactive web interface designed to simplify the management of Docker Compose stacks. Unlike traditional CLI-based approaches, Dockge offers a visually intuitive environment where users can edit, deploy, and monitor their `docker-compose.yaml` files with real-time updates. Built with a modern tech stack including Express.js and React, it emphasizes ease of use, making Docker stack management accessible even to those less comfortable with command-line operations.

## 3. What Software Does It Replace?
Dockge serves as a compelling alternative to several existing tools in the Docker ecosystem:
- **Portainer**: While Portainer offers broader container management, Dockge focuses specifically on Compose stacks with a more streamlined, reactive UI.
- **Docker Compose CLI**: Replaces manual editing and command execution with a web-based, interactive approach.
- **Yacht** and **CasaOS**: For users seeking a lightweight, stack-oriented management tool without the overhead of full-blown container platforms.

## 4. Core Functionality
Key features of Dockge include:
- **Reactive Web UI**: Real-time updates and a modern, responsive interface.
- **Compose File Management**: Edit, validate, and deploy `docker-compose.yaml` files directly through the browser.
- **Stack Deployment**: One-click deployment and management of Docker stacks.
- **Log Viewing**: Integrated log viewer for monitoring container outputs.
- **Environment Variables**: Easy management of environment variables within the UI.
- **Backup and Restore**: Export and import stack configurations for backup or migration.

## 5. Pros and Cons
**Pros:**
- User-friendly interface lowers the barrier to Docker Compose management.
- Real-time reactivity enhances the user experience.
- Lightweight and focused solely on Compose stacks, avoiding feature bloat.
- Active development and strong community support with over 19K stars.

**Cons:**
- Lacks broader container management features found in tools like Portainer.
- Currently in active development, so occasional bugs may occur.
- Requires Docker and Docker Compose pre-installed, which might be a hurdle for absolute beginners.

## 6. Detailed Installation Guide (Self-host)
Follow these steps to deploy Dockge on an Ubuntu server (other Linux distributions are similar).

### Prerequisites:
- A server running Ubuntu 20.04 or later.
- Docker and Docker Compose installed. If not already installed, run:
  ```bash
  sudo apt update && sudo apt install docker.io docker-compose -y
  ```
- Ensure the Docker service is running: `sudo systemctl start docker && sudo systemctl enable docker`.

### Installation Steps:
1. **Create a directory for Dockge:**
   ```bash
   mkdir -p /opt/dockge
   cd /opt/dockge
   ```

2. **Create a `docker-compose.yaml` file:**
   ```bash
   nano docker-compose.yaml
   ```
   Paste the following configuration:
   ```yaml
   version: "3.8"
   services:
     dockge:
       image: louislam/dockge:latest
       restart: unless-stopped
       ports:
         - 5001:5001
       volumes:
         - /var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock
         - ./data:/app/data
         - /opt/dockge/stacks:/opt/stacks
       environment:
         - DOCKGE_STACKS_DIR=/opt/stacks
   ```

3. **Deploy the Stack:**
   ```bash
   docker-compose up -d
   ```

4. **Access Dockge:**
   Open your browser and navigate to `http://your-server-ip:5001`. You should see the Dockge interface ready to manage your Docker Compose stacks.

### Additional Notes:
- To manage existing stacks, ensure they are located in the directory specified in `DOCKGE_STACKS_DIR` (here, `/opt/dockge/stacks`).
- For security, consider setting up a reverse proxy (e.g., Nginx) with SSL termination.

Enjoy streamlined Docker Compose management with Dockge!
