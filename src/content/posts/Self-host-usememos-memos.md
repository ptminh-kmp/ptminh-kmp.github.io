## 6. Detailed Installation Guide (Self-host)

### Prerequisites:
- Ubuntu 20.04+ server (or any Linux distribution)
- Docker and Docker Compose installed
- Basic terminal/command line knowledge

### Step-by-Step Installation:

1. **Update System Packages:**
   ```bash
   sudo apt update && sudo apt upgrade -y
   ```

2. **Install Docker (if not already installed):**
   ```bash
   sudo apt install docker.io docker-compose -y
   sudo systemctl enable docker
   sudo systemctl start docker
   ```

3. **Create Project Directory:**
   ```bash
   mkdir ~/memos && cd ~/memos
   ```

4. **Create Docker Compose File:**
   ```bash
   nano docker-compose.yml
   ```

   Paste the following configuration:
   ```yaml
   version: "3.8"
   services:
     memos:
       image: neosmemo/memos:latest
       container_name: memos
       ports:
         - "5230:5230"
       volumes:
         - ./data:/var/opt/memos
       restart: unless-stopped
   ```

5. **Start the memos Container:**
   ```bash
   sudo docker-compose up -d
   ```

6. **Verify Installation:**
   ```bash
   sudo docker ps
   ```

7. **Access memos:**
   Open your web browser and navigate to `http://your-server-ip:5230`

8. **Initial Setup:**
   - Create your first admin account
   - Start creating memos immediately

### Optional: Reverse Proxy Setup (for domain access)
For production use, consider setting up Nginx or Caddy as a reverse proxy with SSL encryption.

### Maintenance:
- **Backups:** Regularly backup the `./data` directory
- **Updates:** Pull the latest image and restart the container:
  ```bash
  cd ~/memos
  sudo docker-compose pull
  sudo docker-compose up -d
  ```

memos provides a powerful, privacy-focused alternative to commercial note-taking platforms, offering complete control over your data with minimal setup complexity.
