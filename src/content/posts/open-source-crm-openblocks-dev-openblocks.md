## 2. Project Description
OpenBlocks is an open-source, low-code platform designed to help developers and businesses quickly build internal tools, dashboards, and admin panels. It provides a drag-and-drop UI builder with pre-built components, database connectors, and API integrations, enabling teams to create custom applications without extensive coding.

Positioned as a Retool alternative, OpenBlocks emphasizes self-hosting, customization, and developer-friendly workflows while maintaining enterprise-grade capabilities.

## 3. What Software Does It Replace?
OpenBlocks competes with several commercial and open-source solutions:
- **Retool** (Primary alternative)
- **Appsmith** (Open-source competitor)
- **Budibase** (Low-code platform)
- **Internal.io** (SaaS internal tool builder)
- Custom-built admin panels (Saves development time)

## 4. Core Functionality
### Key Features:
- **Drag-and-Drop UI Builder**  
  Pre-built components (tables, forms, charts) with customizable layouts.
- **Database & API Integrations**  
  Supports PostgreSQL, MySQL, MongoDB, REST APIs, GraphQL, and more.
