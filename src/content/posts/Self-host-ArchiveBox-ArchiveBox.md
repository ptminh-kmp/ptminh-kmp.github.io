# ArchiveBox/ArchiveBox - Detailed Review

## 1. Overview & GitHub Stats
- **URL:** [https://github.com/ArchiveBox/ArchiveBox](https://github.com/ArchiveBox/ArchiveBox)
- **Stars:** 24824

## 2. Project Description
ArchiveBox is a powerful, open-source, self-hosted web archiving tool designed to preserve web content for the long term. It allows users to input URLs, browser history, bookmarks, or data from services like Pocket and Pinboard, and saves a comprehensive snapshot including HTML, JavaScript, PDFs, images, videos, and other media. ArchiveBox ensures that you have a local, accessible copy of web content, protecting against link rot and content removal.

## 3. What Software Does It Replace?
ArchiveBox serves as a robust alternative to several commercial and open-source archiving solutions, including:
- Commercial services like Archive.today and Perma.cc.
- Browser-based saving tools such as SingleFile or Save Page WE.
- Cloud-based bookmarking services with limited archiving capabilities, like Pocket (free version) or Evernote.
- Other self-hosted options like Wallabag, though ArchiveBox offers more extensive media and format support.

## 4. Core Functionality
ArchiveBox excels with the following key features:
- **Multi-format Archiving:** Saves content in various formats, including WARC, PDF, screenshot, DOM, and media files.
- **Extensive Input Support:** Accepts URLs from browser history, bookmarks, Pocket, Pinboard, and more.
- **Self-hosted and Offline Access:** All data is stored locally, ensuring privacy and availability without internet dependency.
- **Scheduled and Incremental Archiving:** Allows automated, periodic archiving and updates to existing archives.
- **Search and Browse Interface:** Provides a user-friendly web UI to search, view, and manage archived content.
- **Extensibility:** Supports plugins and custom archiving methods for tailored use cases.

## 5. Pros and Cons
**Pros:**
- **Open Source and Free:** No licensing costs, with full transparency and community support.
- **Comprehensive Archiving:** Captures a wide range of content types beyond simple HTML.
- **Self-hosted Privacy:** User data remains private and under their control.
- **Active Development:** Regular updates and a growing community ensure ongoing improvements.
- **Cross-platform Compatibility:** Works on Linux, macOS, and Windows, with Docker support simplifying deployment.

**Cons:**
- **Resource Intensive:** Archiving large numbers of URLs can demand significant storage and processing power.
- **Steep Learning Curve:** Initial setup and configuration may be challenging for non-technical users.
- **Dependency on External Tools:** Relies on tools like Chromium, wget, and others, which might require maintenance.
- **Limited Real-time Archiving:** Best suited for scheduled rather than instantaneous archiving needs.

## 6. Detailed Installation Guide (Self-host)
Follow these steps to deploy ArchiveBox on an Ubuntu server:

### Prerequisites:
- Ubuntu 20.04 or later.
- Docker and Docker Compose installed.
- Python 3.8+ (optional, for non-Docker setup).

### Step-by-Step Installation with Docker (Recommended):
1. **Update System Packages:**
   ```bash
   sudo apt update && sudo apt upgrade -y
   ```

2. **Install Docker and Docker Compose:**
   ```bash
   sudo apt install docker.io docker-compose -y
   sudo systemctl enable docker && sudo systemctl start docker
   ```

3. **Create a Directory for ArchiveBox:**
   ```bash
   mkdir ~/archivebox && cd ~/archivebox
   ```

4. **Download the Docker Compose File:**
   ```bash
   curl -O https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ArchiveBox/ArchiveBox/master/docker-compose.yml
   ```

5. **Initialize and Start ArchiveBox:**
   ```bash
   docker-compose run archivebox init --setup
   docker-compose up -d
   ```

6. **Access the Web Interface:**
   Open your browser and navigate to `http://your-server-ip:8000` to access the ArchiveBox UI.

### Adding URLs to Archive:
- Use the web interface to add URLs manually.
- Or, use the command line:
  ```bash
  docker-compose run archivebox add 'https://example.com'
  ```

### Optional: Non-Docker Installation (Advanced):
If you prefer a non-Docker setup, ensure Python 3.8+ is installed, then:
```bash
sudo apt install python3-pip python3-venv -y
python3 -m venv archivebox-env
source archivebox-env/bin/activate
pip install archivebox
archivebox init
archivebox manage createsuperuser
archivebox server 0.0.0.0:8000
```

### Maintenance Tips:
- Regularly update ArchiveBox: `docker-compose pull && docker-compose up -d`.
- Monitor storage usage, as archives can grow quickly.
- Back up your data directory periodically.
