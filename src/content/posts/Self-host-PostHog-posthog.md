# PostHog/posthog - Detailed Review

## 1. Overview & GitHub Stats
- **URL:** [https://github.com/PostHog/posthog](https://github.com/PostHog/posthog)
- **Stars:** 28566

## 2. Project Description
PostHog is an all-in-one, open-source platform designed to help businesses understand user behavior, optimize product features, and run experiments without relying on third-party services. It combines web and product analytics, session recording, feature flagging, and A/B testing into a single, self-hostable solution. Built with a modern tech stack including Python, Django, and React, PostHog empowers teams to maintain full control over their data while leveraging powerful insights to drive growth.

## 3. What Software Does It Replace?
PostHog serves as a comprehensive alternative to several popular commercial and open-source tools, including:
- **Mixpanel** and **Amplitude** for product analytics.
- **Hotjar** or **FullStory** for session recording.
- **LaunchDarkly** or **Split** for feature flagging.
- **Optimizely** or **Google Optimize** for A/B testing.
By consolidating these functionalities, PostHog reduces tool sprawl and offers a unified, cost-effective solution for data-driven teams.

## 4. Core Functionality
PostHog's feature set is robust and multifaceted:
- **Product Analytics:** Track events, funnels, retention, and user paths to understand how people interact with your product.
- **Session Recording:** Capture and replay user sessions to identify UX issues and opportunities.
- **Feature Flags:** Safely roll out new features with targeted releases and kill switches.
- **A/B Testing:** Run experiments to test hypotheses and optimize conversion rates.
- **Self-Hosting:** Deploy on your own infrastructure for data privacy, security, and compliance.
- **Integrations:** Connect with tools like Slack, Salesforce, and data warehouses for extended functionality.

## 5. Pros and Cons
**Pros:**
- **Open Source:** Free to use, modify, and extend; transparent development.
- **All-in-One Platform:** Reduces dependency on multiple SaaS tools.
- **Data Ownership:** Self-hosting ensures data never leaves your environment.
- **Active Community:** Strong GitHub presence with regular updates and contributions.
- **Scalable:** Handles high volumes of events and users efficiently.

**Cons:**
- **Self-Hosting Complexity:** Requires technical expertise to deploy and maintain.
- **Resource Intensive:** Can demand significant server resources for large-scale deployments.
- **Learning Curve:** New users may need time to fully leverage all features.
- **Limited Managed Option:** While a cloud version exists, the core value is in self-hosting, which isn't for everyone.

## 6. Detailed Installation Guide (Self-host)
Follow these steps to deploy PostHog on an Ubuntu server (20.04 or later). This guide assumes you have basic familiarity with Linux commands and Docker.

### Prerequisites:
- Ubuntu server (recommended: 4GB RAM, 2 vCPUs).
- Docker and Docker Compose installed.
- Domain name pointed to your server (for HTTPS).

### Step 1: Update System and Install Docker
```bash
sudo apt update && sudo apt upgrade -y
sudo apt install apt-transport-https ca-certificates curl software-properties-common -y
curl -fsSL https://download.docker.com/linux/ubuntu/gpg | sudo gpg --dearmor -o /usr/share/keyrings/docker-archive-keyring.gpg
echo "deb [arch=amd64 signed-by=/usr/share/keyrings/docker-archive-keyring.gpg] https://download.docker.com/linux/ubuntu $(lsb_release -cs) stable" | sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/docker.list > /dev/null
sudo apt update
sudo apt install docker-ce docker-ce-cli containerd.io -y
sudo systemctl enable docker && sudo systemctl start docker
```

### Step 2: Install Docker Compose
```bash
sudo curl -L "https://github.com/docker/compose/releases/download/v2.23.0/docker-compose-$(uname -s)-$(uname -m)" -o /usr/local/bin/docker-compose
sudo chmod +x /usr/local/bin/docker-compose
```

### Step 3: Clone PostHog and Configure
```bash
git clone https://github.com/PostHog/posthog.git
cd posthog
cp .env.template .env
```
Edit `.env` to set:
- `SECRET_KEY`: Generate a secure key (e.g., using `openssl rand -hex 32`).
- `SITE_URL`: Your domain (e.g., `https://posthog.yourdomain.com`).

### Step 4: Start PostHog with Docker Compose
```bash
docker-compose up -d
```
This will pull images and start services including PostgreSQL, Redis, and the PostHog app.

### Step 5: Set Up Reverse Proxy (Nginx) and SSL
Install Nginx and Certbot:
```bash
sudo apt install nginx certbot python3-certbot-nginx -y
```
Create an Nginx config file at `/etc/nginx/sites-available/posthog`:
```nginx
server {
    listen 80;
    server_name posthog.yourdomain.com;

    location / {
        proxy_pass http://localhost:8000;
        proxy_set_header Host $host;
        proxy_set_header X-Real-IP $remote_addr;
    }
}
```
Enable the site and get SSL certificate:
```bash
sudo ln -s /etc/nginx/sites-available/posthog /etc/nginx/sites-enabled/
sudo nginx -t && sudo systemctl reload nginx
sudo certbot --nginx -d posthog.yourdomain.com
```

### Step 6: Access PostHog
Navigate to `https://posthog.yourdomain.com` in your browser. Complete the setup wizard to create an admin account and start using PostHog.
