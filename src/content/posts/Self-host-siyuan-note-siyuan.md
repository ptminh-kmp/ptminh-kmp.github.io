# siyuan-note/siyuan - Detailed Review

## 1. Overview & GitHub Stats

- **URL:** [https://github.com/siyuan-note/siyuan](https://github.com/siyuan-note/siyuan)
- **Stars:** 36779

## 2. Project Description

Siyuan Note is a cutting-edge, privacy-first personal knowledge management software that combines the power of TypeScript and Golang to deliver a seamless, self-hosted note-taking experience. Unlike cloud-based solutions, Siyuan prioritizes user data sovereignty by enabling complete local storage and synchronization across devices without relying on third-party servers. Its block-based editing system allows for flexible organization of ideas, while supporting rich media integration, making it an ideal tool for researchers, writers, and anyone looking to manage their digital thoughts securely.

## 3. What Software Does It Replace?

Siyuan Note serves as a robust alternative to several popular commercial and open source knowledge management tools, including:

- **Notion**: While Notion offers extensive collaboration features, Siyuan provides similar functionality with enhanced privacy and offline capabilities.
- **Evernote**: For users seeking a more customizable and self-hosted note-taking solution without subscription fees.
- **Obsidian**: Though Obsidian is also markdown-based and local-first, Siyuan differentiates with its real-time collaboration and built-in sync options.
- **OneNote**: Ideal for those who prefer open source software over Microsoft's ecosystem.

## 4. Core Functionality

Siyuan Note boasts a comprehensive set of features designed for efficient knowledge management:

- **Block-Based Editing**: Organize content in customizable blocks, similar to Notion, allowing for dynamic document structures.
- **Real-Time Collaboration**: Multiple users can edit documents simultaneously when hosted on a private server.
- **End-to-End Encryption**: Secure your notes with encryption, ensuring that only authorized users can access them.
- **Cross-Platform Sync**: Synchronize notes across devices using self-hosted or cloud storage solutions like WebDAV.
- **Rich Media Support**: Embed images, videos, audio, and code snippets seamlessly into your notes.
- **Graph View**: Visualize connections between notes with an interactive graph, helping to uncover relationships between ideas.
- **Template System**: Use pre-built templates for journals, project plans, and more to speed up note creation.

## 5. Pros and Cons

### Pros:
- **Privacy-First**: All data is stored locally or on your own server, giving you full control.
- **Open Source**: Transparent development community with regular updates and contributions.
- **Powerful Features**: Combines the best of block-based editing with advanced organization tools.
- **Self-Hosted Flexibility**: Deploy on your own infrastructure, avoiding vendor lock-in.
- **Active Community**: Strong GitHub presence with extensive documentation and user support.

### Cons:
- **Steep Learning Curve**: New users may need time to adapt to the block-based system and advanced features.
- **Self-Hosting Complexity**: Requires technical knowledge to set up and maintain, especially for synchronization.
- **Limited Mobile Experience**: While functional, the mobile app is not as polished as some commercial alternatives.

## 6. Detailed Installation Guide (Self-host)

Follow these steps to self-host Siyuan Note on an Ubuntu server (22.04 LTS or later). This guide assumes you have sudo privileges and a basic understanding of Linux commands.

### Prerequisites:
- Ubuntu Server (22.04 LTS recommended)
- Docker and Docker Compose installed
- A domain name pointed to your serverâ€™s IP (optional for HTTPS)

### Step 1: Update System and Install Docker
```bash
sudo apt update && sudo apt upgrade -y
sudo apt install docker.io docker-compose -y
sudo systemctl enable docker
sudo systemctl start docker
```

### Step 2: Create a Directory for Siyuan
```bash
mkdir ~/siyuan && cd ~/siyuan
```

### Step 3: Create a Docker Compose File
Create a `docker-compose.yml` file with the following content:

```yaml
version: '3'
services:
  siyuan:
    image: b3log/siyuan:latest
    container_name: siyuan
    restart: unless-stopped
    ports:
      - "6806:6806"
    volumes:
      - ./data:/opt/siyuan/data
    environment:
      - TZ=UTC
```

### Step 4: Deploy Siyuan Note
```bash
sudo docker-compose up -d
```

### Step 5: Access Siyuan Note
Open your browser and navigate to `http://your-server-ip:6806`. You should see the Siyuan interface. For production use, consider setting up a reverse proxy (e.g., Nginx) with SSL for secure access.

### Step 6: (Optional) Set Up Nginx Reverse Proxy
Install Nginx and create a configuration file:
```bash
sudo apt install nginx -y
sudo nano /etc/nginx/sites-available/siyuan
```

Add the following configuration, replacing `your-domain.com` with your actual domain:
```nginx
server {
    listen 80;
    server_name your-domain.com;

    location / {
        proxy_pass http://localhost:6806;
        proxy_set_header Host $host;
        proxy_set_header X-Real-IP $remote_addr;
    }
}
```

Enable the site and restart Nginx:
```bash
sudo ln -s /etc/nginx/sites-available/siyuan /etc/nginx/sites-enabled/
sudo nginx -t
sudo systemctl restart nginx
```

For HTTPS, install Certbot and obtain an SSL certificate:
```bash
sudo apt install certbot python3-certbot-nginx -y
sudo certbot --nginx -d your-domain.com
```

You now have Siyuan Note running securely on your own server!
