KaraKeep is an innovative, self-hostable bookmarking application that enables users to save and organize various types of content—including web links, personal notes, and images—with the added power of AI-driven automatic tagging and comprehensive full-text search. Designed for privacy-conscious users and organizations, it offers a modern alternative to cloud-based bookmarking services by allowing complete control over data.

Key features of KaraKeep include:
- **Multi-format Support:** Save links, notes, and images in one unified platform.
- **AI-Powered Tagging:** Automatically generates relevant tags using machine learning, reducing manual organization effort.
- **Full-Text Search:** Quickly locate saved content with powerful search capabilities.
- **Self-Hosted Deployment:** Complete data ownership and privacy with on-premise or private cloud hosting.
