## 6. Detailed Installation Guide (Self-host)

Follow these steps to deploy Focalboard on an Ubuntu server (22.04 LTS or later). This guide assumes you have sudo privileges and basic command-line knowledge.

### Prerequisites:
- Ubuntu Server (22.04+)
- Docker and Docker Compose installed
- A domain name pointed to your server (optional for HTTPS)

### Step 1: Update System and Install Docker
```bash
sudo apt update && sudo apt upgrade -y
sudo apt install docker.io docker-compose -y
sudo systemctl enable docker && sudo systemctl start docker
```

### Step 2: Create a Docker Compose File
Create a directory for Focalboard and navigate into it:
```bash
mkdir focalboard && cd focalboard
```

Create a `docker-compose.yml` file:
```yaml
version: '3'

services:
  focalboard:
    image: mattermost/focalboard:latest
    ports:
      - "8000:8000"
    environment:
      - DB_TYPE=sqlite3
      - DB_CONFIG='./focalboard.db'
    volumes:
      - ./data:/opt/focalboard/data
    restart: unless-stopped
```

### Step 3: Deploy Focalboard
Run the following command to start the container:
```bash
sudo docker-compose up -d
```

### Step 4: Access Focalboard
Once deployed, access Focalboard via your server's IP or domain at port 8000 (e.g., `http://your-server-ip:8000`). You can set up a reverse proxy with Nginx and SSL for production use.

### Step 5: Optional - Secure with Nginx and Let's Encrypt
Install Nginx and Certbot:
```bash
sudo apt install nginx certbot python3-certbot-nginx -y
```

Create an Nginx configuration file for your domain (e.g., `/etc/nginx/sites-available/focalboard`):
```nginx
server {
    listen 80;
    server_name your-domain.com;

    location / {
        proxy_pass http://localhost:8000;
        proxy_set_header Host $host;
        proxy_set_header X-Real-IP $remote_addr;
    }
}
```

Enable the site and obtain SSL certificate:
```bash
sudo ln -s /etc/nginx/sites-available/focalboard /etc/nginx/sites-enabled/
sudo nginx -t && sudo systemctl reload nginx
sudo certbot --nginx -d your-domain.com
```

Your Focalboard instance is now live and secured with HTTPS!
