#### Step 2: Add Verification Code to Jekyll website

##### Using Adsense Code snippet

1. Create `_includes` folder at your Jekyll project

```bash
cd [your-jekyll-project]
mkdir _includes
```

2. Create `head.html` file in `_includes` folder.

```bash
touch head.html
```

3. Copy and paste all content of `head.html` in this link: <https://github.com/cotes2020/jekyll-theme-chirpy/blob/master/_includes/head.html>
4. Create `google-adsense.html` file in `_includes` folder.

```bash
touch google-adsense.html
```

5. Edit `google-adsense.html` file with your Google Adsense Snippet above.

```text
<script async src="https://pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js?client=[your-ca-pub-id]"
     crossorigin="anonymous"></script>
```

1. Edit `head.html`:

```html
  <head>
    <!--some code above-->
    {% include metadata-hook.html %}
    <!--add this line-->
    {% include google-adsense.html %} 
  </head>
```

##### Using Ads.txt snippet

1. Create `ads.txt` file in your Jekyll project:

```bash
  touch ads.txt
```

2. Edit `ads.txt` file with your Ads.txt snippet.

##### Using Meta tag

1. Edit `head.html` file in `_includes` folder.
2. Add Google Adsense meta tag insite `<head>` tag:

```html
<head>
  <meta http-equiv="Content-Type" content="text/html; charset=UTF-8">
  <meta name="theme-color" media="(prefers-color-scheme: light)" content="#f7f7f7">
  <meta name="theme-color" media="(prefers-color-scheme: dark)" content="#1b1b1e">
  <meta name="mobile-web-app-capable" content="yes">
  <meta name="apple-mobile-web-app-status-bar-style" content="black-translucent">
  <!--add this line-->
  <meta name="google-adsense-account" content="[your-meta-tag]">
  <meta
    name="viewport"
    content="width=device-width, user-scalable=no initial-scale=1, shrink-to-fit=no, viewport-fit=cover"
  >
  <!--some remain code-->
</head>
```

#### Step 3: Verify code and monitoring

1. **AdSense Verification**: Google will review your site to ensure it complies with their policies. This may take some time.
2. **Check Ad Display**: Once approved, ads should start appearing on your site.
3. **Monitor Performance**: Use your AdSense dashboard to track your earnings and ad performance.
4. **Optimize Ad Placement**: Experiment with different ad placements to maximize revenue.

### Tips for Success

- **Content is King**: Focus on creating high-quality, engaging content.
- **Responsive Design**: Ensure your website and ads are responsive across devices.
- **Ad Placement Optimization**: Avoid placing too many ads or ads that disrupt user experience.
- **AdSense Policies**: Adhere to Google's AdSense policies to avoid account suspension.
