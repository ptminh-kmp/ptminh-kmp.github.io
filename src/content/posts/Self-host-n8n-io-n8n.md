## 6. Detailed Installation Guide (Self-host)

### Prerequisites
- Ubuntu 20.04+ server (or similar Linux distribution)
- Docker and Docker Compose installed
- Minimum 2GB RAM (4GB recommended for production)
- Domain name with DNS configured (for web access)

### Step-by-Step Installation

1. **Update System Packages**
```bash
sudo apt update && sudo apt upgrade -y
```

2. **Install Docker and Docker Compose**
```bash
sudo apt install docker.io docker-compose -y
sudo systemctl enable docker
sudo systemctl start docker
```

3. **Create n8n Directory**
```bash
mkdir ~/n8n && cd ~/n8n
```

4. **Create Docker Compose File**
Create `docker-compose.yml` with the following content:

```yaml
version: '3.8'
services:
  n8n:
    image: n8nio/n8n
    restart: unless-stopped
    ports:
      - "5678:5678"
    environment:
      - N8N_HOST=your-domain.com
      - N8N_PORT=5678
      - N8N_PROTOCOL=https
      - NODE_ENV=production
    volumes:
      - n8n_data:/home/node/.n8n
volumes:
  n8n_data:
```

5. **Start n8n Service**
```bash
docker-compose up -d
```

6. **Configure Reverse Proxy (Optional but Recommended)**
Install nginx and configure reverse proxy for SSL:

```bash
sudo apt install nginx -y
sudo systemctl enable nginx
```

Create nginx configuration file at `/etc/nginx/sites-available/n8n`:

```nginx
server {
    listen 80;
    server_name your-domain.com;

    location / {
        proxy_pass http://localhost:5678;
        proxy_set_header Host $host;
        proxy_set_header X-Real-IP $remote_addr;
    }
}
```

Enable the site and restart nginx:
```bash
sudo ln -s /etc/nginx/sites-available/n8n /etc/nginx/sites-enabled/
sudo systemctl restart nginx
```

7. **Access n8n**
Open your browser and navigate to `https://your-domain.com` (or `http://your-server-ip:5678` if not using reverse proxy)

8. **Initial Setup**
- Create your first user account
- Configure your base URL in settings
- Set up your first workflow or explore templates

### Maintenance
- Regularly update n8n by pulling the latest Docker image
- Monitor disk usage for the n8n_data volume
- Set up regular backups of your workflow configurations

For production use, consider additional security measures including:
- SSL certificate installation
- Firewall configuration
- Regular security updates
- Database externalization (PostgreSQL) for better performance
