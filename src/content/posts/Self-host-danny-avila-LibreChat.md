## 6. Detailed Installation Guide (Self-host)

Follow these steps to deploy LibreChat on an Ubuntu server (or similar Linux distribution). This guide assumes you have basic familiarity with the command line and Docker.

### Prerequisites

- Ubuntu 20.04 or later
- Docker and Docker Compose installed
- Node.js (v18 or higher) â€“ optional for certain customizations
- Git

### Step 1: Update System and Install Dependencies

```bash
sudo apt update && sudo apt upgrade -y
sudo apt install -y curl git
```

### Step 2: Install Docker and Docker Compose

```bash
# Install Docker
curl -fsSL https://get.docker.com -o get-docker.sh
sudo sh get-docker.sh

# Install Docker Compose
sudo curl -L "https://github.com/docker/compose/releases/download/v2.20.0/docker-compose-$(uname -s)-$(uname -m)" -o /usr/local/bin/docker-compose
sudo chmod +x /usr/local/bin/docker-compose
```

### Step 3: Clone the LibreChat Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/danny-avila/LibreChat.git
cd LibreChat
```

### Step 4: Configure Environment Variables

Copy the example environment file and customize it:

```bash
cp .env.example .env
nano .env
```

Update key variables such as:

- `OPENAI_API_KEY` (or keys for other providers like Anthropic, AWS, etc.)
- `JWT_SECRET` for authentication
- Database and Redis settings (if using external services)

### Step 5: Start the Application with Docker Compose

```bash
docker-compose up -d
```

This command will pull the necessary images and start LibreChat in detached mode.

### Step 6: Access LibreChat

Once the containers are running, access the application at `http://your-server-ip:3080` (replace with your server's IP address). You can create an account and start using LibreChat immediately.

### Additional Notes

- For production use, consider using a reverse proxy (e.g., Nginx) with SSL.
- Monitor resource usage, as AI models can be computationally intensive.
- Regularly update the repository to benefit from the latest features and security patches.
