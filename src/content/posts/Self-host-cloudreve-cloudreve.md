## 6. Detailed Installation Guide (Self-host)
Follow these steps to deploy Cloudreve on an Ubuntu server (22.04 LTS recommended). This guide uses Docker for simplicity and reproducibility.

### Prerequisites:
- Ubuntu server (22.04 LTS)
- Docker and Docker Compose installed
- Basic familiarity with Linux command line

### Step 1: Update System and Install Docker
```bash
sudo apt update && sudo apt upgrade -y
sudo apt install docker.io docker-compose -y
sudo systemctl enable docker && sudo systemctl start docker
```

### Step 2: Create a Directory for Cloudreve
```bash
mkdir ~/cloudreve && cd ~/cloudreve
```

### Step 3: Create Docker Compose File
Create a `docker-compose.yml` file with the following content:

```yaml
version: '3.8'
services:
  cloudreve:
    image: cloudreve/cloudreve:latest
    container_name: cloudreve
    restart: unless-stopped
    ports:
      - "5212:5212"
    volumes:
      - ./uploads:/cloudreve/uploads
      - ./conf.ini:/cloudreve/conf.ini
      - ./cloudreve.db:/cloudreve/cloudreve.db
    environment:
      - TZ=Asia/Shanghai  # Adjust to your timezone
```

### Step 4: Deploy Cloudreve
```bash
sudo docker-compose up -d
```

### Step 5: Access and Configure
Once deployed, access Cloudreve at `http://your-server-ip:5212`. The initial admin account and password will be displayed in the container logs. Retrieve them with:

```bash
sudo docker logs cloudreve
```

Log in, change the default password, and configure your storage backends and user settings through the web admin panel.

### Step 6 (Optional): Set Up Reverse Proxy
For production use, set up a reverse proxy with Nginx or Apache and SSL for secure access.

This setup provides a functional instance of Cloudreve. For advanced configurations, refer to the official [Cloudreve documentation](https://docs.cloudreve.org/).
