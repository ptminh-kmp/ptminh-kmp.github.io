## 2. Project Description

HeyPuter/puter is an ambitious open-source project that bills itself as "The Internet OS." It provides a free, self-hostable operating system environment that runs directly in your web browser. By combining the familiarity of a traditional desktop interface with modern web technologies, Puter offers a versatile platform for application deployment, file management, and collaborative work—all accessible from any device with a browser. Its architecture emphasizes privacy, user control, and extensibility, making it an attractive alternative to proprietary cloud-based solutions.

## 3. What Software Does It Replace?

Puter can serve as a replacement for several types of software, including:

- **Cloud Storage & Collaboration Platforms:** Google Drive, Dropbox, and OneDrive.
- **Remote Desktop & VDI Solutions:** Windows Remote Desktop, Citrix Virtual Apps.

**Cons:**

- **Self-Hosting Complexity:** Requires technical knowledge to deploy and maintain.
- **Limited Native App Performance:** Heavier applications may not perform as well as native desktop software.
- **Early Stage:** Some features may still be in development or lack polish compared to commercial alternatives.
- **Dependency on Browser:** Performance and compatibility can vary across different browsers.

## 6. Detailed Installation Guide (Self-Host)

This guide will walk you through deploying Puter on an Ubuntu 22.04 LTS server. The process uses Docker for simplified dependency management.

**Prerequisites:**

- Ubuntu 22.04 LTS server with a non-root sudo user.
- Docker and Docker Compose installed.
- Basic familiarity with the command line.

**Step 1: Update System and Install Docker**

```bash
sudo apt update && sudo apt upgrade -y
sudo apt install docker.io docker-compose -y
sudo systemctl enable docker --now
```

**Step 2: Clone the Repository**

```bash
git clone https://github.com/HeyPuter/puter.git
cd puter
```

**Step 3: Configure Environment Variables**
Create a `.env` file in the project root and customize the following variables (adjust as needed):

```plaintext
PORT=3000
DB_PATH=./data/db
```

**Step 4: Build and Start with Docker Compose**
Run the following command to build and start the services:

```bash
docker-compose up -d
```

**Step 5: Verify Deployment**
Check if the container is running:

```bash
docker ps
```

Access Puter by navigating to `http://your-server-ip:3000` in your web browser.

**Step 6: (Optional) Set Up Reverse Proxy with Nginx**
For production use, set up Nginx as a reverse proxy:

1. Install Nginx:

   ```bash
   sudo apt install nginx -y
   ```

2. Create a new configuration file at `/etc/nginx/sites-available/puter`:

   ```nginx
   server {
       listen 80;
       server_name your-domain.com;

       location / {
           proxy_pass http://localhost:3000;
           proxy_set_header Host $host;
           proxy_set_header X-Real-IP $remote_addr;
       }
   }
   ```

3. Enable the configuration and restart Nginx:

   ```bash
   sudo ln -s /etc/nginx/sites-available/puter /etc/nginx/sites-enabled/
   sudo nginx -t && sudo systemctl restart nginx
   ```

Your self-hosted Puter instance is now live and accessible! For further customization, refer to the [official documentation](https://github.com/HeyPuter/puter).
