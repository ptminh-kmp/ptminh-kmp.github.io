sudo chmod +x /usr/local/bin/docker-compose
```

4. **Create Airbyte Directory**
```bash
mkdir airbyte && cd airbyte
```

5. **Download Docker Compose File**
```bash
curl -sO https://raw.githubusercontent.com/airbytehq/airbyte/master/{.env,docker-compose.yaml}

   - Change password immediately after first login

2. **Configure Storage**
   - Set up persistent volumes for data storage
   - Configure backup strategy for critical data

3. **Network Configuration**
   - Ensure proper firewall rules for required ports
   - Set up SSL/TLS for secure access

### Maintenance Commands

```bash
# Check service status
docker-compose ps

# View logs
docker-compose logs -f

# Restart services
docker-compose restart

# Update to latest version
docker-compose down
git pull origin master
docker-compose up -d
```

### Troubleshooting Tips

- Ensure ports 8000 (web UI) and 8001 (API) are accessible
- Check Docker resource allocation if experiencing performance issues
- Monitor disk space for growing data volumes
- Review logs for connector-specific issues

This installation provides a production-ready Airbyte instance that can scale with your data integration needs while maintaining full control over your data infrastructure.
