### Prerequisites
- Ubuntu 20.04/22.04 LTS server
- 1GB RAM minimum (2GB recommended)
- Docker and Docker Compose installed
- Domain name pointing to your server

### Step-by-Step Installation

**1. Update System Packages**
```bash
sudo apt update && sudo apt upgrade -y
```

**2. Install Docker**
```bash
sudo apt install docker.io docker-compose -y
sudo systemctl enable --now docker
```

**3. Create Docker Compose File**
Create `docker-compose.yml`:
```yaml
version: '3'

services:
  server:
    image: gitea/gitea:latest
    container_name: gitea
    environment:
      - USER_UID=1000
      - USER_GID=1000
      - DB_TYPE=sqlite3
    restart: always
    volumes:
      - ./gitea:/data
      - /etc/timezone:/etc/timezone:ro
      - /etc/localtime:/etc/localtime:ro
    ports:
      - "3000:3000"
      - "2222:22"
```

**4. Deploy Gitea**
```bash
mkdir gitea
docker-compose up -d
```

**5. Configure Gitea**
Access your server at `http://your-server-ip:3000` and complete the initial setup:
- Set database to SQLite3
- Configure domain and SSH settings
- Create admin account

**6. Set Up Reverse Proxy (Optional but Recommended)**
Install Nginx:
```bash
sudo apt install nginx -y
```

Create Nginx configuration at `/etc/nginx/sites-available/gitea`:
```nginx
server {
    listen 80;
    server_name your-domain.com;

    location / {
        proxy_pass http://localhost:3000;
        proxy_set_header Host $host;
        proxy_set_header X-Real-IP $remote_addr;
        proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-For $proxy_add_x_forwarded_for;
        proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-Proto $scheme;
    }
}
```

Enable the site:
```bash
sudo ln -s /etc/nginx/sites-available/gitea /etc/nginx/sites-enabled/
sudo nginx -t
sudo systemctl reload nginx
```

**7. SSL Certificate (Recommended)**
Install Certbot:
```bash
sudo apt install certbot python3-certbot-nginx -y
sudo certbot --nginx -d your-domain.com
```

Your Gitea instance is now ready! You can start creating repositories, inviting team members, and enjoying your self-hosted Git solution.

### Maintenance
- Regular backups: Backup the `./gitea` directory
